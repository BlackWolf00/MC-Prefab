Please provide answers to the following questions when submitting an issue.

This helps me figure out the issue faster. If answers are not provided, I may ask them again.

1. What version of Minecraft and forge are you running?
1. What version of the mod are you running? (Make sure you are running the latest for the version of Minecraft you are running.)
1. If you're having an issue with a recipe not being craftable or just not working:
    1. Did you check the configuration file to determine if the recipe got disabled? 
        1. All recipes are enabled by default unless you or a modpack developer disabled them.
    1. Does the recipe show up in JEI (Just Enough Items)?
    1. If you are using Extra Utilities and cannot craft certain blueprints, make sure you aren't using their version of Compressed Stone/Dirt.
    1. Which blueprints are working (if any)?
1. Are you running a specific modpack on CurseForge that I can use to test it out? Personal modpacks and modpacks from other distribution sites are hard for me to test with.
