This mod is designed to provide a way to generate structures using items and materials.

The building designs are pre-determined (hence the pre-fabrication idea) but can have small pieces of configuration.

# Items:
## Starting House
* This item is added to the player's inventory the first time they join the world (or first time joining the world with the option on) and is used to create a simple player house. When using the item, the house is built at the location the item is right-clicked on and the player is teleported to that location (so the block generation doesn't kill them). It also clears a 10-block radius and 15 block height area around the player before the house building starts. This is so there is an open area for the house.
* The house can face in any direction specified when using the item on a block.
* The house structure materials and chest contents can be changed in the configuration gui shown when using the item on a block.
    * The walls can be any of the vanilla varieties of wood planks.
    * The door and outside stair will be the same type of wood as the walls.
    * The floor can be Stone Brick, Brick (the red ones) or Sandstone.
    * The ceiling can be Stone Brick, Brick (the red ones) or Sandstone.
    * The ceiling can be flat or vaulted (made of stairs).
    * Torches can be added on the inside of the house.
        *There will be 1 torch per wall.
	* A sign will be posted outside the house next to the stair with the following message.
		* This is
		* [Insert Players Name]
		* House!
    * The house can be decorated with the following items. These can all be turned off in the configuration.
        * Bed
        * Crafting table (with furnace that has 20 coal).
        * Double Wide Chest.
        * If a chest is added it can have the following contents.
            * All vanilla stone tools/sword.
            * 20 Bread.
            * 3 wheat seeds.
            * 3 potatoes.
            * 3 carrots.
            * Full set of leather armor.
			* Full stack of cobblestone
			* Full stack of dirt
			* 3 Oak saplings
			* 20 Torches
        * Outside torches. There will be multiple torches on each wall.
            * If the ceiling is flat there will be multiple torches on the roof.
        * If the ceiling is vaulted it will have 1 torch at it's peak.
        * Outside farm.
            * This farm is added on the north side of the house. It will be set up as follows.
            * 3 water sources in a line with a glass block and torch above them.
            *Farmland will surround the water sources on each side (including the corners).
