This mod is designed to provide a way to generate structures using items and materials.

The building designs are pre-determined (hence the pre-fabrication idea) but can have small pieces of configuration.
 
# Notes:
You can use this in any mod pack.
Please provide feedback on additional structures to add (using vanilla blocks/items is preferred).
If you find issues please let me know.
